In this section, we address the following aspects of a sharding specification:
the semantics of a sharding specification,
checking a sharding specification for validity,
and inferring a complete sharding specification given a partial one.

**Semantics of the sharding spec**:
We start with an informal description of the intended behavior of a sharding spec.
Operationally, the execution of an annotated node proceeds as below:
first, the input data is partitioned or repartitioned, as necessary, to
ensure that it is in the sharded form specified in the node.
This potentially involves communication operations among the different devices.
Next, a parallelized implementation of the operation is applied to the sharded
data.
Finally, the output is produced in the sharded form specified in the node.
This too may involve the use of communication collective ops.

**Validity of a sharding spec**:
Note that not all input sharding specs make sense.
For example, consider the addition operator `Add(A,B)`, where both inputs are
two dimensional tensors of shapes `[32, 1024]`. Sharding the first input between
two devices along axis 0 and the second input between the same two devices
along axis 1 does not make sense. In fact, we typically expect both inputs to be
sharded the same way. 

A sharding-checker to check if a given input sharding spec makes sense would be
useful and we recommend building one. The correctness requirements, however, vary from
operator to operator, though they mostly fall into one of a few different groups,
described in more detail below.

Note that the output sharding spec for a node does not have to be consistent with
the input sharding spec of the node.
This is useful when we want to reshard the output to be more suitable for the consumers
of the output.

However, even if a given sharding spec makes sense, a particular implementation
may not support it. The implementation should ideally provide feedback to
the user indicating this, but may choose to use an alternative implementation
or abort. Different users and scenarios may have different requirements (on
whether an alternative parallel or sequential implementation is preferable or not.)
Thus, a particular implementation may have stricter requirements on the set of sharding
specs that it supports.

**Inference of missing elements of a sharding spec**:
A validity checker can be extended to automatically infer some missing elements of a sharding
spec, as we outline below.

* If no input sharding spec is provided for a node's input X, it is assumed to be the same as
the sharding spec specified for X at the node that produces the value X.
* If X is a model input, then X is assumed to be unsharded.

If no output sharding spec is provided for a node's output, it is inferred from the node's
input sharding spec and the node's operation. In general, this may vary from operator to
operator. The inference scheme is outlined for a few core groups of operators below.

**Extensions**:
Currently, the sharding spec does not allow a way of specifying a sharding for the model
inputs. Sharded model inputs could be useful in an execution setting where the model input
already exists in sharded form, making it easier to compose sharded execution.
Extensions to the sharding spec to enable this is future work.

## Restrictions on Sharding Specs

Informally, constraints on sharding follow from parallelizability of the computation along
the different axes of the input and output tensors. Often the computation of the output
can be expressed in terms of loops (iterations) over the different axes of the input and/or output tensors.
If the iteration over a specific axis can be expressed as a parallel loop, sharding along
that axis makes sense. If that iteration is a reduction loop, sharding along that axis may
still work, but require a subsequent collective (multi-device) reduction after the local
reductions on each device.

### Unary elementwise ops

List of operations:
_Abs, Acos, Acosh, Asin, Asinh, Atan, Atanh, Cast, Ceil, Cos, Cosh, Dropout, Erf, Exp, Floor, Identity, IsInf, IsNaN, Log, Max, Min, Neg, Not, Reciprocal, Round, Sigmoid, Sign, Sin, Sinh, Tan, Tanh, ConstantOfShape_.

**Constraints on input sharding**
* No constraints on input sharding.

**Inference of output sharding**
* If not specified, the output sharding is the same as input sharding

### Broadcast n-ary elementwise ops

List of operations:
_Add, And, BitShift, BitwiseAnd, BitwiseNot, BitwiseOr, BitwiseXor, Equal, Greater, Less, Mod, Mul, Or, Pow, Sub, Sum, Where, Xor_.

**Constraints on input sharding**
* For any non-broadcast axis, the sharding spec of the two (or more) inputs must be identical
* Any broadcast axis of size 1 (in the unsharded original tensor) must be replicated across all devices that participate in the parallel computation (that is, all devices identified in the node's sharding spec).

**Inference of output sharding**
* The sharding spec for any axes of the output is the same as the sharding spec for the axes of the
corresponding input axes in the case of non-broadcast. In the case of broadcast, the output axes
derives the sharding spec from the corresponding input axes with a size other than 1, if any.
In the special case where all corresponding input axes have a size of 1, the output axis inherits
the same sharding (that is, replicated across all devices of the node op).

_Note_: The above can be generalized, but the generalization is hard to describe in words.
TODO: either add example figures or code to describe more complex scenarios.

### Reduction ops

**Constraints on input sharding**
* No constraints on input sharding.
* Sharding along non-reduction axes is straightforward, since parallel iteration over the non-reduction
axes is possible.
* Sharding along reduction axes can be supported, but it requires an implicit collective-reduce operation.

**Inference of output sharding**
* Non-reduction axes inherit the sharding of the corresponding axes of the input.
* Two natural possibilities exist for the reduction axes, if they are sharded. The result can be
broadcast to all devices containing some shard along the reduction axes, or just to the devices
containing a distinguished shard (say, the first one). As a default, we assume a broadcast (the
first option).

### MatMul-like ops

List of operations: MatMul, Gemm, quantized variations of these ops, special cases of EinSum

The constraints for these ops follow analogous cases above. Consider the simple case of matrix multiplication
of two matrices of dimensions `[M, K]` and `[K, N]` producing an output matrix of dimension `[M, N]`.
Axis 0 of the first input (with value `M`) is conceptually broadcast to the second input.
Hence, its constraints and handling are similar to the treatment of broadcast axes for n-ary
elementwise ops.
Axis 1 of the second input (with value `N`) is also handled similarly.

The axes with size value `K` represent reduction axes. The corresponding two axes must have
compatible sharding.

### Pooling and Convolution ops

List of operations:
_AveragePool, GlobalAveragePool, GlobalLpPool, GlobalMaxPool, LpPool, MaxPool, MaxRoiPool,_
_Conv, ConvInteger, ConvTranspose, DeformConv,_
_InstanceNorm, LpNormalization, LayerNormalization_ 

### Unsupported ops

The following ops are not supported in this version:

* Operations on sequences and optional values.
* Control-flow ops, such as _If, Loop, Scan_.
* _GRU, LSTM, RNN, DFT, STFT, MelWeightMatrix, TfidVectorizer_
